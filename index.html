       <p> Hello! I am a PhD candidate at the Indian Statistical Institute, Delhi Centre, specializing in the study of questions in Industrial Organization and Environment.  My research applies theoretical and structural econometric methods from Industrial Organization to explore the key issues in emerging markets.</p>

        
<p>Prior to my PhD, I earned an Masters of Arts in Economics from the Delhi School of Economics with first class and a Bachelors of Arts (Hons.) in Economics from Jadavpur University, where I received the University Gold Medal.</p>

        <p> I grew up in <a href="https://desh.tourism.gov.in/attractions/detail/623">Bagdogra</a>, a serene town in northern West Bengal, often called the “Gateway to the Himalayas.” Nestled between tea gardens and the Himalayan foothills, it’s a place where leopards, elephants, and monkeys remind us that the wild is never far away. </p>
        
        <p><strong>I will be on the 2025-26 job market.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>To Reverse or Not to Reverse? Auction Format and Renewable Energy Procurement in India (Job Market Paper)</strong><br>

  <summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
            <p>
   Auction design has played a central role in shaping renewable energy markets globally. We study
the effect of auction format changes on the prices and efficiency in the procurement of green energy using
data on the universe of solar procurement auctions in India from 2015 − 2021. Exploiting variation in auction
formats at central and state levels, we find that open (reverse) auctions lower tariff bids by 8 − 17 percent
relative to sealed-bid formats. Markups, measured via bid-to-cost ratios, are 11 − 20 percent lower under open
auctions. We provide causal evidence of deviation from the Revenue Equivalence Theorem and attribute it to
the presence of interdependent costs. Structural estimates with affiliated costs corroborate the causal findings,
showing a 16.12 percent reduction in winning bids under open format relative to sealed format. Considering
the 104 open auctions conducted during this period, total government savings over the 25-year contract horizon
are estimated at approximately 5.52 billion USD. Together, these findings highlight the efficiency gains from
open auctions in the procurement of green energy and suggest that such formats can accelerate the global
transition to a cleaner future.

        <h2>Math is hard, let's go shopping</h2>

        <p>In first grade I learned that 5 &gt; 3 and 2 &lt; 7. Maybe some arrows. 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3. 9 &lt;- 8 &lt;- 7.</p>

        <p>Triangles man! a^2 + b^2 = c^2</p>

        <h2>We all like making lists</h2>

        <p>The above header should be an H2 tag. Now, for a list of fruits:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Red Apples</li>
          <li>Purple Grapes</li>
          <li>Green Kiwifruits</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Let's get crazy:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>This is a list item with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor<br>
            sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit<br>
            mi posuere lectus.</p>

            <p>Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet<br>
            vitae, risus. Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum<br>
            sit amet velit.</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.</p></li>
        </ol>

        <p>What about some code <strong>in</strong> a list? That's insane, right?</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>In Ruby you can map like this:</p>

            <pre><code>['a', 'b'].map { |x| x.uppercase }</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>In Rails, you can do a shortcut:</p>

            <pre><code>['a', 'b'].map(&amp;:uppercase)</code></pre>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Some people seem to like definition lists</p>

        <dl>
          <dt>Lower cost</dt>
          <dd>The new version of this product costs significantly less than the previous one!</dd>
          <dt>Easier to use</dt>
          <dd>We've changed the product so that it's much easier to use!</dd>
        </dl>

        <h2>I am a robot</h2>

        <p>Maybe you want to print <code>robot</code> to the console 1000 times. Why not?</p>

        <pre><code>def robot_invasion
  puts("robot " * 1000)
end
</code></pre>

        <p>You see, that was formatted as code because it's been indented by four spaces.</p>

        <p>How about we throw some angle braces and ampersands in there?</p>

        <pre><code>&lt;div class="footer"&gt;
    &amp;copy; 2004 Foo Corporation
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

        <h2>Set in stone</h2>

        <p>Preformatted blocks are useful for ASCII art:</p>

        <pre>             ,-.
    ,     ,-.   ,-.
   / \   (   )-(   )
   \ |  ,.&gt;-(   )-&lt;
    \|,' (   )-(   )
     Y ___`-'   `-'
     |/__/   `-'
     |
     |
     |    -hrr-
  ___|_____________
</pre>

        <h2>Playing the blame game</h2>

        <p>If you need to blame someone, the best way to do so is by quoting them:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I, at any rate, am convinced that He does not throw dice.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Or perhaps someone a little less eloquent:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I wish you'd have given me this written question ahead of time so I<br>
        could plan for it... I'm sure something will pop into my head here in<br>
        the midst of this press conference, with all the pressure of trying to<br>
        come up with answer, but it hadn't yet...</p>

        <p>I don't want to sound like<br>
        I have made no mistakes. I'm confident I have. I just haven't - you<br>
        just put me under the spot here, and maybe I'm not as quick on my feet<br>
        as I should be in coming up with one.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Table for two</h2>

        <table>
          <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>ID</th>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Rank</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>1</td>
        <td>Tom Preston-Werner</td>
        <td>Awesome</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2</td>
        <td>Albert Einstein</td>
        <td>Nearly as awesome</td>
          </tr>
