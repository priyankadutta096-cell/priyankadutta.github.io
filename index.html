      <section>

       <p> Hello! I am a PhD candidate at the Indian Statistical Institute, Delhi Centre, specializing in the study of questions in Industrial Organization and Environment.  My research applies theoretical and structural econometric methods from Industrial Organization to explore the key issues in emerging markets.</p>

        
<p>Prior to my PhD, I earned an Masters of Arts in Economics from the Delhi School of Economics with first class and a Bachelors of Arts (Hons.) in Economics from Jadavpur University, where I received the University Gold Medal.</p>

        <p> I grew up in <a href="https://desh.tourism.gov.in/attractions/detail/623">Bagdogra</a>, a serene town in northern West Bengal, often called the “Gateway to the Himalayas.” Nestled between tea gardens and the Himalayan foothills, it’s a place where leopards, elephants, and monkeys remind us that the wild is never far away. </p>
        
        <p><strong>I will be on the 2025-26 job market.</strong></p>

   Auction design has played a central role in shaping renewable energy markets globally. We study
the effect of auction format changes on the prices and efficiency in the procurement of green energy using
data on the universe of solar procurement auctions in India from 2015 − 2021. Exploiting variation in auction
formats at central and state levels, we find that open (reverse) auctions lower tariff bids by 8 − 17 percent
relative to sealed-bid formats. Markups, measured via bid-to-cost ratios, are 11 − 20 percent lower under open
auctions. We provide causal evidence of deviation from the Revenue Equivalence Theorem and attribute it to
the presence of interdependent costs. Structural estimates with affiliated costs corroborate the causal findings,
showing a 16.12 percent reduction in winning bids under open format relative to sealed format. Considering
the 104 open auctions conducted during this period, total government savings over the 25-year contract horizon
are estimated at approximately 5.52 billion USD. Together, these findings highlight the efficiency gains from
open auctions in the procurement of green energy and suggest that such formats can accelerate the global
transition to a cleaner future.

        <p><strong>(When) Are Mixed Markets Good for Consumers?</strong> <em>(Revise and Resubmit in Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization) </em> <a hyref=""> [Link] </a><br>

  Are consumers best served in a purely private regime with efficient but profit-maximizing private
firms, a purely public regime with inefficient but welfare-maximizing public firms, or a mixed regime com-
prising both efficient private firms and welfare-oriented public firms? In standard symmetric oligopolies (e.g.,
homogenous product Cournot and differentiated Bertrand) consumer surplus (CS) is highest either when all
firms are public or when all firms are private. A mixed regime never delivers the maximum CS. When firms
exhibit innate cost heterogeneity unrelated to ownership, mixed markets can fare better than both public and
private regimes when high-cost firms are privatized. A mixed regime where only relatively low-cost firms are
private is never in the best interest of consumers and indeed can be worse than a fully public or fully private
regime. As a by-product of our analysis, we uncover a possible non-monotone relationship between competi-
tion and privatization under Cournot, and a novel regime-contingent best response function under Bertrand
competition.

      <p><strong>Public versus Private Provision in Congested Markets</strong> <a hyref=""> [Link] </a><br>

  For many products and services, consumers’ utility declines as the firm they purchase
from expands its consumer base. An increase in the number of patients leads to longer waiting
times in hospitals. Internet connection speeds slow down as the number of users grows.
Service delays become more frequent with an increase in the number of customers. Disutility
arising from congestion is evident in several sectors, including healthcare, telecommunications,
and banking. These sectors, where congestion occurs, are often served by both public
and private firms, which differ in two key aspects: efficiency and objectives. Private firms are
more efficient and focus on profit maximization, whereas public firms are relatively inefficient
and focus on welfare maximization.
              
We examine how firms respond to an increase in congestion disutility and how the presence
of congestion affects the choice between public and private provision. We begin with the
case of a monopoly. As congestion disutility increases, both public and private monopolists
reduce the number of consumers they serve. A public monopolist raises prices in response to
increased congestion. However, a private monopolist’s pricing strategy may vary depending
on demand conditions—prices might increase, decrease, or remain unchanged (as is the case
with linear demand). The relationship between investment in capacity and congestion disutility
is non-monotonic: investment in capacity increases if and only if congestion disutility
is below a certain threshold. Regardless of the metric used—welfare, consumer surplus, or
prices—we find that congestion tends to favor private over public provision. Notably, in congested
markets, private provision can deliver higher consumer surplus despite higher prices.
All these results obtained under monopoly also hold in the presence of competition. Furthermore,
competition facilitates private provision.

         <p><strong>Subsidies for Solar Based Electricity Generation: Evidence from India</strong> <a hyref=""> [Link] </a><br>

  <summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
            <p>
  India has made significant strides in expanding its solar market since initiating pilot projects in
1980. This exceptional growth can be attributed to various central and state solar policies. The major push
in 2014 came from the central government with the introduction of the Viability Gap Funding (VGF) scheme
under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission (JNNSM). This initiative included a reverse bidding process
on capital subsidy to allocate capacity development among developers. Using a novel auction dataset from
2010 − 2021, we investigate whether the provision of capital subsidies has contributed to reducing overall solar
power tariffs. Our analysis, based on a generalized difference-in-differences (DiD) approach, indicates that
the implementation of the VGF scheme resulted in a reduction of the effective feed-in tariff (FiT) inclusive
of subsidies. The capital subsidy has resulted in effective FiT by 1.71 standard deviations during the post-
treatment period relative to the year preceding the policy implementation. Additionally, we find that subsidy
led to the central policy projects experiencing lower effective tariffs compared to state policy projects. However,
we find no evidence of differential impact of subsidies based on market concentration levels. There is some
suggestive evidence that market concentration increased following the implementation of subsidy policy.
